## Method

### **Preparation**

1. Toast the cumin, coriander, and mustard seeds in a pan on medium-high heat until the seeds start popping.

2. Place the toasted seeds in a pestle and mortar with a generous pinch of flake salt and the rest of the spice mix and grind to a powder.

### **Cooking**

3. Heat both oils and onions in a pot over medium heat until soft.

4. Add the garlic, ginger, and chilli and sweat for a few more minutes.

5. Add spices with a splash of water, maintaining medium heat. Cook for a few extra minutes until fragrant.

6. Add the lentils, tomatoes, coconut milk, and vegetable stock to the pot and bring to a simmer.

7. Cook for minimum 20 minutes, seasoning along the way; if the pot is still watery, add some plain flour to thicken the sauce.

### **Service**

8. Once the consistency is correct, squeeze in fresh lemon juice and stir. Serve with rice, salsa, and a coriander garnish.

## Notes

> If you're feeling lazy, replace the seed toasting stage with store bought pre-ground spices. If so, be slightly more liberal with the spice measurements.
