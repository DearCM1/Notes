This is a solid, impossibly healthy, weekday meal that is super low effort and is great for reheating. A vegetable, fibre, and protein bomb.

## Method

### **Preparation**

1. Sweat the **onions** and **carrots** to a large pot with **olive oil** on medium heat until soft and translucent.

2. Next, add the **aubergine** and **courgette**, cook until they start to char.

3. Add the **garlic** to the pan, once soft, add in the **tinned tomatoes**, cook for 10 minutes over medium heat.

4. Add in the **lentils**, **beans**, **chicken stock**, **oregano**, **thyme**, **coriander**, **smoked paprika**, **MSG**, and a generous amount of **salt** and **pepper**. Simmer on a low heat for 40 minutes, stirring occasionally to avoid anything from sticking to the bottom and seasoning as you go.

> Check to see if the lentils are cooked, otherwise add more water.
### **Service**

5. Serve in bowls, add some coriander leaves, basil leaves, or seeds on top if you have any.
